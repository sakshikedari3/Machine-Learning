Built a machine learning pipeline to predict product sales based on advertising spend across TV, radio, and newspaper channels. 
The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis (correlation heatmaps, pairplots), model training using linear regression, 
and performance evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics. All outputs—including trained models, visualizations, 
and logs—are organized in a reusable `Artifacts` folder for clarity and reproducibility.
